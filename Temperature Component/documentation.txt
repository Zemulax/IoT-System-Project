Sensor => continously record data
       => write to temprecordings file

client => read temprecordings file
       => process the data
           -> aggregate average temperature over a period of 1 minute
       => assign labels 
          -> if average > x : high temperature
             --> this is normal
          -> if average < x : low temperature
             --> this is abnormal; trigger the actuator
       => write labels to tempreport file
           send tempreport file to the server if label abnormal

Server => read the tempreport file 
       => display on dashboard
       => further escalation




here is what I got:

clientModule
=> calls SensorModule to run
=> reads temperaure log file
   -> gathers data every 30 seconds
   -> analyses data to to check for trend below threthold
   -> logs processed trends to an external file

SensorModule
=> logs temperature data to an external file


Client-ServerModule
=>establishes link to the server
=>transmits processed data to the server
